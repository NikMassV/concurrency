The Goal:
    Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
but allows subclasses to choose the type of objects that will be created.

Decision:
    Delegation of instance creation another class

Example:
    - It is not known in advance which type need to create
    - Class is projected thus created instances should have properties exact class
