The Goal:
    Separate abstraction from implementation, so that we can change them independently

Decision:
    Get advantages of inheritance without sacrificing flexibility

Example:
    - Low coupling
    - Expanding implementation and abstraction via subclasses
    - Implementation changing should not affect client's abstractions
    - Separating implementation between several objects
